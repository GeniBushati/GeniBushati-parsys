-In order to properly execute, monitor and cancel jobs in a HPC, the jobs should be submitted to the job scheduling system (SGE-Son of Grid Engine) in our case.
This is done by using several commands. Most important amongs them are qsub, qstat and qdel.
-qsub name_of_script - Is a command used to submit jobs into the batch system.
-qstat - Is a command used to get information about the running and waiting jobs
-qdel job-id - Is a command used to delete the job with the give job id as an argument.

First of all, if we are talking about executing a parallel programs, we should determine the number of slots allocated per node.
For example: In the case of openmpi-Xperhost, the parameter X specifies the number of cores used per node.

-Parallel programs,need an environment in order to be executed. When running a job in a parallel environment, it 
is important to know the list of the available environments, which can be found by executing the command qconf -spl. 
In our case the available environments are:

make
mpi
openmp
openmpi-1perhost
openmpi-2perhost
openmpi-4perhost
openmpi-8perhost
openmpi-fillup
smp
