-In order to properly execute, monitor and cancel jobs in a HPC, the jobs should be submitted to the 
 job scheduling system (SGE-Son of Grid Engine) in our case.
 This is done by using several commands. Most important amongs them are qsub, qstat and qdel.
-qsub name_of_script - Is a command used to submit jobs into the batch system.
-qstat - Is a command used to get information about the running and waiting jobs
-qdel job-id - Is a command used to delete the job with the give job id as an argument.

 Firstly, the most important parameter when we discuss execution in parallel environment, is the number-of-slots.
 It determines how the resources to execute this job are going to be shared.
 Another important parameter when submitting a job is the name of the queue. 
 It is important becauese it specifies the queue to be used, although the default queue is std.q. To select the
 queue we should use -q [name_of_queue].
 Thirdly, the parameter of the job name determines the name of the job. The default name of the job, is the
 file name of the script. TO set the name of the job we use -N[name].
 Yet another important parameter is v_hmem, which determines the size of allocated memory per slot.
 It is defined -l h_vmem = [size_of_memory]. 

-Parallel programs,need an environment in order to be executed. When running a job in a parallel environment, it 
 is important to know the list of the available environments, which can be found by executing the command qconf -spl. 
 In our case the available environments are:

-make
-mpi
-openmp
-openmpi-1perhost
-openmpi-2perhost
-openmpi-4perhost
-openmpi-8perhost
-openmpi-fillup
-smp

Based on the environment, it is determined how the resources for the execution of the parallel program, are going to be shared.
For example: In the openmpi-Xperhost, X the represents the number of processes that each host get.
In the openmpi-fillup X a number of X slots are allocated across an arbitrary number of hosts.
The environment can also take these parameters: openmpi-fillup X-Y environment where the job will 
run on no less than X cores and no more than Y cores, accord to the availability of the cores.
In the openmp X environment a number of X cores will be assigned for the execution of the parallel program.
This environment should be chosen when working with threaded applications.
When selecting a parallel environment the statement should always start with -pe, otherwise SGE will assume that the
job is sequential.
